ULTIMATE CONVERTER
Installation and usage instructions


*INTRODUCTION:*
Welcome to Ultimate Converter, the best tool for converting numerical data. This program will serve the purpose of teaching its users about the various numbering systems that are prevalent, especially in computer engineering and coding. Secondly, it will provide the opportunity for the user to explore how numbering manipulation can be achieved through programming.
What makes Ultimate Converter different from other software is that the source code is readily available to everyone. This means that it is perfect for use within various classrooms and learning spaces, particularly with programming classes, in which the students may manipulate the code to their liking in order to explore and see what happens when they change different aspects of the code.
The end result is a fun, interactive, and interesting experience with a topic that is otherwise usually dull and boring. So, letâ€™s dive into how to get set up!


*INSTALLATION GUIDE:*
Ultimate Converter is available in two formats. The first is the original C++ file, whereas the second is the exe program. Below are the installation instructions for each format.
Please note, both of these methods will only be successful for Windows Operating systems.


*USING THE EXE PROGRAM:*
1) Download the exe file provided to a known location on your computer
2) Open the folder that the file was downloaded to
3) Right click on the file and click on `Open`
4) Follow the programs instructions as they are prompted on screen
5) When the program has finished running, an output file may have been written to the folder that the program was downloaded to. Check the file to see a record of your inputs.


*USING THE CPP FILE:*
1) Download the cpp file to a known location on your computer
2) Make sure an appropriate C++ compiler is installed on the computer. To do this, refer to the MinGW installation instructions which can be found at the following site: http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started
3) Press and hold Shift on your keyboard, then right click on any whitespace area in the folder. **Do not click on the file itself.**
4) Select `Open command window here`
5) Type in the following command: `g++ ultimateConverter.cpp -o ultimateConverter.exe`
6) Press the enter key. After a few sections, you will be able to type again. Type in the following command: `ultimateConverter.exe`
7) Press the enter key, and the program will run. Follow the instructions as they are provided on the screen.


*VIEWING THE SOURCE CODE*

8) If you would like to view the source code itself, you can browse through the files available in the GitHub Repository that this README.md file is in. If you would like to view this project on a personal computer, you will need a program that is capable of viewing C++ files, such as Atom Text Editor, available from the following website address: https://atom.io/
9) After you have downloaded the Atom Text Editor, go to the folder where the C++ file was downloaded.
10) Right click on the file, and select `Open With`
11) Select `Atom`
12) The source code will be opened in the Atom Text Editor
13) Read the comments within the source code to see how the program works
